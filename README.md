# Tweet-Based-Movie-Intelligent-Marketing

### Created an end to end user application for Movie Producers using movie's trailer tweets retrieved from Twitter. 

Task was to analyze the feedback of a trailer (either positive or negative) based on tweets that have mentioned the movie trailer, for example, using hashtags. 

Twitter is one of the most popular social media where people post comments about their everyday life. 
Users share their reviews about a movie’s trailer on Twitter which possibly encourage or discourage their followers’ motivations of watching the movie. Since Twitter restricts each tweet to be less than 140 characters, users’ comments tend to be straightforward. In addition, because of its huge influences, many movies have started to include a hashtag in their trailers that tell people to tweet about them to attract social attention. Therefore, Twitter has become a great platform to examine people’s feedback on a trailer. By analyzing the sentiment of thousands of tweets by people who have watched the trailer, a general review of the movie can be made. Producers can then use the review to decide in what amount the movie should be screened in a particular city.
