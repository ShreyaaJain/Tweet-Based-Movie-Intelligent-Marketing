# Tweet-Based-Movie-Intelligent-Marketing

### Created an end to end user application for Movie Producers using movie's trailer tweets retrieved from Twitter to analyze the feedback of a trailer (either positive or negative) based on tweets that have mentioned the movie trailer by using hashtags. 

By analyzing the sentiment of thousands of tweets by people who have watched the trailer, a general review of the movie can be made. Producers can then use the review to decide in what amount the movie should be screened in a particular city.
